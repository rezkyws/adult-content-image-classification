# cnn-nsfw
This is a deep learning modeling project (using a convolutional neural network) with ResNet as a pre-trained model or architecture that classifying images into NFSW (adult content) and non-adult content classes with an accuracy of 80%. The dataset I got from Kaggle and this project used TensorFlow.

Note : you can remove callback and re-run code to get better accuracy or performance
