# cnn-nsfw
This is a deep learning modeling project (using a convolutional neural network) that classifying images into NFSW (adult content) and non-adult content with ResNet as a pre-trained model or architecture classes and an accuracy of 80%. The dataset I got from Kaggle and this project used TensorFlow.

Note : you can remove callback and re-run code to get better accuracy or performance. I training the model just until 80% because of the resource limitation
